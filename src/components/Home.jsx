      <h1>Welcome to the SCP Archive</h1>
      <p>Secure. Contain. Protect.</p>
      <p>Operating clandestine and worldwide, the Foundation acts beyond conventional jurisdiction, with the task of containing anomalous objects, entities, and phenomena.

We maintain an extensive database of information regarding anomalies requiring Special Containment Procedures, commonly referred to as "SCPs"; all of which undermine the natural laws that the people of the world implicitly trust in.

We operate to maintain normalcy, so that the worldwide civilian population can live and go on with their daily lives without fear, mistrust, or doubt in their personal beliefs, and to maintain human independence from extraterrestrial, extradimensional, and other extranormal influence.

Our mission is threefold:

Secure — secure anomalies to prevent them from falling into the hands of civilian or rival agencies through extensive observation and surveillance, acting to intercept anomalies at the earliest opportunity.
Contain — contain anomalies to prevent spread of their influence or effects; by either relocating, concealing, or dismantling them, or by suppressing public dissemination of knowledge thereof.
Protect — protects humanity as well as the anomalies themselves until such time that they are either fully understood or new theories of science can be devised based on their properties and behavior.
Additional information will have been provided upon your joining us in pursuit of our goals. Welcome to the Foundation, and good luck.</p>
